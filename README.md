Welcome to the Query Machine.

This is a little app that turns your search terms into bite-size pieces in the optimal sizes for Binder querying. 
It's easy:
1. Type your search term into the box.
2. Select the character length that you want (hint: This isn't very effective for search terms that are <5 letters).
3. Select whether you want vowels or not.
4. Click "Start Choppin'"

The query terms are returned in table format, so you should be able to copy it straight into a spreadsheet without too much fiddling. The input and your selections don't clear, so you can make new selections and run it again and still have your last query terms results. The use-case in mind was largely so that you have both a 'with vowels' and 'without vowels' set of results.

Hit refresh in your browser to clear results away. I'll add a reset button soon, as well as a "run both" functionality regarding vowels. 

Got a feature you want added? Let me know and I'll get to work on adding it to the app (hopefully without breaking it.)
